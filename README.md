## üìã Project Overview

BF1Kart is a data mining project developed for BestFinansBir (BF1) to optimize credit card marketing campaigns. The model predicts customer likelihood to purchase the new BF1Kart credit card, enabling targeted marketing efforts and cost reduction.

The solution employs Random Forest classification, trained on partner company data with similar customer structure, to identify high-potential customers for marketing outreach.


## üéØ Project Objectives
- Develop high-accuracy classification model for credit card purchase prediction
- Reduce customer acquisition costs and optimize marketing resource allocation
- Enable data-driven marketing decisions

- Random Seed State: 4711

### Project Phases
1. **Data Understanding**
   - Feature analysis
   - Distribution examination
   - Correlation studies

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Missing value handling
   - Feature encoding
   - Data normalization
   - Data splitting for training and testing

3. **Modeling**
